# Neu-Item-Converter

This is a Script to convert all NEU items into a File for [MmoItems](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mmoitems-premium.39267/), Run `npm test` or `node index.js` to convert all items
copy everything from items.yml into a Type in MmoItems, reload the plugins and you have all items from Hypixel Skyblock

# Incompleted!

Some items are still missing the right types, i will slowly fix that but might not be fully

# Future

Plans for the Future:

- Add support for ItemEdit
- Add Support for MythicMobs?
